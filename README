== Ratchet - A simple authenticated RSS feed bridge

Ratchet is a simple rails app that provides a bridge between authenticated RSS feeds and RSS readers that don't support them (Google Reader, I'm looking at you).

== Getting Started

Install the app on your server.  Currently there's no web interface, so you'll have to create new feeds on the console!

  script/console
  
  >> feed = Feed.create! :host => 'twitter.com', :path => '/replies.atom', :username => 'tomafro', :password => 'supersecure'
  => #<Feed id: 2, host: "twitter.com", path: "/replies.atom", username: "tomafro", password: "supersecure", token: "605b27a7f253dbeb34a45b0fe48c0d5d">
  >> app.feed_url(feed, :host => 'yourhost.com')
  => "http://yourhost.com/feeds/605b27a7f253dbeb34a45b0fe48c0d5d"
  
Then add the feed url to your RSS reader and you should be good to go
